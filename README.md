  <h1><b>üé® zappy-place</b></h1>  </a>
  <strong>A fully decentralized, censorship-resistant pixel canvas inspired by Reddit Place ‚Äî powered by <a href="https://nostr.com">Nostr</a></strong>
</div>

## Inspiration

- https://www.reddit.com/r/place/
- http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/
- https://pxls.space

## üöÄ Features

- üß± Canvas state is **derived from Nostr relays**

## üé® User Experience

### How it works
- Pixels are drawn in a preview mode. Cost is calculated based on the pricing structure below.
- When you're happy with your design, you can submit it by clicking the submit button.
  - You can optionally add a URL and message to your pixels to advertise whatever you like.
- Zaps are sent to [pay@zappy-place.pages.dev](https://nostr.band/npub12kflsgh8vfj22w8usk4dpj8rw2umsktfcpyw38jfj07ndh8uzmvs0xente)
- When the zap is received, the pixels are drawn on the canvas in real time.
- All pixels are validated in chronological order.


### Cost Structure
- **1 sat per new pixel** - Base pricing for empty spaces
- **Age-based overwrite pricing** - Protects recent work while allowing evolution
  - Fresh pixels (< 1 hour): 10 sats to overwrite
  - Recent pixels (1-24 hours): 5 sats to overwrite
  - Older pixels (1-7 days): 2 sats to overwrite
  - Ancient pixels (> 1 week): 1 sat to overwrite
- **Real-time cost tracking** - See total cost before submitting (varies by age)
- **Cost breakdown display** - Detailed pricing explanation by pixel age categories
- **Smart relocation tool** - Drag entire designs to find cheaper placement areas
- **Visual age indicators** - Color-coded pixels showing relative placement costs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure

### Domain Boundaries

**`packages/nostr-client`** - **Nostr Domain Layer**
- **All Nostr communication**: connecting to relays, subscribing to events, publishing events
- **Event encoding/decoding**: gzip + base64 compression for pixel data
- **Age-based pricing**: calculating pixel costs based on age
- **Zap request creation**: building kind 9734 zap request events
- **Event validation**: validating incoming zap events and pixel data
- **Canvas state management**: building canvas state from validated events
- **Lightning integration**: handling LNURL-pay and WebLN payment flow

**`apps/client`** - **Presentation Layer**
- **Pixel rendering**: PixiJS-based canvas rendering
- **UI interactions**: click handlers, preview mode, batch selection
- **Camera/viewport**: zoom, pan, viewport management
- **Input handling**: mouse/touch interactions for pixel placement
- **Visual feedback**: preview mode, cost display, loading states
- **State management**: UI state only (not business logic)

## üñºÔ∏è Nostr Event Format

*Note: This section documents the protocol specification. All event handling, encoding/decoding, and validation is implemented in the `@zappy-place/nostr-client` package.*

### üß± Batched Pixel Placement Zap Request (kind: 9734)
```json
{
  "kind": 9734,
  "pubkey": "<sender_pubkey>",
  "created_at": 1234567900,
  "content": "eJyrVkosLcmIz8nPS1WyUoLB+OTi/KLM9FQlKyVnv5BCK6W4oqiYoLSqYnGcmJAUhIwB",
  "tags": [
    ["p", "<canvas_pubkey>"],            // Zap receiver
    ["relays", "wss://relay.example.com"],
    ["app", "zappy-place"],
    ["encoding", "gzip+base64:v1"],
    ["amount", "15000"]                  // Total msat value (varies by pixel age: 1 new + 2 fresh overwrites)
	["message", "<message>"],
	["url", "<url>"]
  ]
}
```

**Content Field**: Base64-encoded gzip-compressed pixel data
- Raw format: `x,y,color\nx,y,color\n...` (newline-separated)
- Example raw: `42,19,#ff0000\n43,19,#ff0000\n44,19,#00ff00`
- Compressed and encoded for efficient transmission

### üîß Implementation Details

All encoding/decoding, validation, and event handling is implemented in the `@zappy-place/nostr-client` package. The client app does not need to understand the Nostr protocol details - it only needs to:

1. **Submit pixels**: `await canvas.submitPixels(previewPixels)`
2. **Receive pixel updates**: Handle the `onPixelUpdate` callback
3. **Display costs**: Handle the `onCostUpdate` callback

The nostr-client package handles:
- Gzip compression and base64 encoding
- Age-based pricing calculations
- Event validation and filtering
- Optimistic rendering with retroactive validation
- Lightning payment integration

## ‚úÖ Validation Rules (nostr-client Package)
*These validation rules are implemented in the `@zappy-place/nostr-client` package:*

1. Only accept `kind: 9734` zap request events with pixel data
	- Must contain `["app", "zappy-place"]` tag
	- Must have `["encoding", "gzip+base64:v1"]` tag
	- Must have valid `["amount", "msat_value"]` tag
2. Decode and validate pixel data
	- Decompress base64 + gzip content field
	- Parse newline-separated `x,y,color` format
3. Validate zap payment amount with age-based pricing
	- New pixels: 1000 msats (1 sat)
	- Overwriting pixels < 1 hour old: 10000 msats (10 sats)
	- Overwriting pixels 1-24 hours old: 5000 msats (5 sats)
	- Overwriting pixels 1-7 days old: 2000 msats (2 sats)
	- Overwriting pixels > 1 week old: 1000 msats (1 sat)
	- Total amount must equal sum of individual pixel prices
4. Validate pixel coordinates and colors
	- Coordinates must be within canvas bounds
	- Colors must be valid hex format (#rrggbb)
5. Optimistic rendering with retroactive validation
	- Render events immediately for instant feedback
	- Validate pricing as historical data becomes available
	- Remove invalid events from canvas if validation fails
	- Visual indicators for temporary vs confirmed pixels
6. Handle pixel conflicts (same coordinate)
	- Later timestamp wins (most recent zap)
	- Validate bolt11 invoice amount matches declared amount
